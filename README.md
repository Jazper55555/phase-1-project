# Phase 1 Project - BOTW Materials List

This is my Phase-1 Project Submission for FlatIron School. Details on the webpage's purpose and functionality are described below.

## Introduction/Purpose

This purpose of this webpage is to display ALL of the materials a player can find within the world of Nintendo's highly popular game *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild* When a player selects an image, more information regarding that image is displayed.

## Navigating the Webpage

Within the webpage, ALL of the materials that can be found in *BOTW* are displayed as pictures. Simply hovering over an image with the mouse will reveal that images name as well as a description of the selected item. When the mouse leaves an image, the text dissapears. The idea is relatively simple and gives users the ability to find relevent information on requested items as needed.
